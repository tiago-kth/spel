So, yeah, this is my (tentative?) "dev blog" for the course [DH2650 Computer Game Design](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2650?l=en) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology!

## Day 0 - First Lecture

This was a very exciting start. It was very interesting to listen to some of the other students' favorite games -- which I have never played.

I am older than most (or maybe older than everyone?) in my class, and I have two small children. I used to play a lot, but after my oldest son was born (9 years ago), I completely stop playing. Now that he and his sister (who is 7) are bit older, I am sorta getting back to play, but mostly Minecraft, wich they adore.

When I was around 15, I went to the United States for the first time in my life. I was living in my home country, Brazil, and my aunt was taking some of my cousins to Disney World, and I went along. I remember that my father gave me US$ 300 to spend in the trip, and I used it all to buy computer games. That was in the 90s, and some of what would become my favorite games had just been released, such as "X-Com: Ufo Defense", "Sid Meier's Civilization II", "Sid Meier's Colonization" (all three from Microprose), "Warcraft: Orcs and Humans" (Blizzard) and "Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis" (LucasArts). I spent a good part of my life in those games, specially during my bachelor's degree. Fortunately, I had many annoying non-gamer friends that would come to my place and literally take me out of my computer. I remember travelling with them to spend holidays in the countryside, and thinking all the way through the trip about the trade routes I would be starting or where to place my next alien surveillance base when I was back home.

But I have always loved reading as well. Just the last week, I found out that I might be a "literay gamer". I had just finished ["Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow", by Gabrielle Zevin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58784475-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow) (more on that later), and -- as I usually do, **after** reading a book -- I was reading reviews and interviews about it. I came accross [this piece, in The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/books/review/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-gabrielle-zevin.html), by Tom Bissell, that opens like this:

> Most kids who play a lot of video games don’t grow up to become avid readers. Then again, not every kid who reads a lot of books grows up to become an avid reader. Yet, in the diverse taxonomy of the modern gaming audience, there exists the Literary Gamer — someone for whom reading and playing are, and always have been, the same voyage. It would never occur to the Literary Gamer that one activity negates the other. If anything, the Literary Gamer believes, reading and playing enhance systematic thinking and the mysteries of imaginative empathy. This reviewer, for better or worse, is an avowed Literary Gamer — and I call upon my brothers and sisters to join me in a recitation of  Fünke’s Axiom: “There are dozens of us! DOZENS!”

So, that's it. I'm part of the DOZENS. And that's probably why I do like books with lore. :) I will even read books that extend the games' lore!

I guess my favorite genre is Strategy, especially turn-based-strategy games. That includes the whole Civilization series (I started with the very fist one, and played up to the fifth -- I still want to try the latest one, Civilization VI), the Master of Orion series (the second one was amazing), X-Com: UFO Defense (a superb game), the Heroes of Might and Magic series. But also some real-time strategy games, such as the Warcraft series, Age of Empires 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire.

The last game that really absorbed me, before my exile when my son was born, was FTL: Faster Than Light. I remember wanting to play it after reading an [amazing story in PC Gamer magazine about it](https://www.pcgamer.com/ftl-preview-2/). I think it is amazing to see how a graphically simple game can instill such an immersive experience in its players, leading some, like the PC Gamer piece's writer, to even create a "mini-lore" out of a single play.

How can we design such a thing?

And that brings me back to "Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow". It's not a perfect book, but it is a story ambiented in the 90s about two friends building a game by themselves. At some point, one of the characters says something that rang very true (and very close to something Björne said today during the lecture):

> To design a game is to imagine the person who will eventually play it.

> You’re a builder of worlds, and if you’re a builder of worlds, your feelings are not as important as what your gamers are feeling. You must imagine them at all times. There is no artist more empathetic than the game designer.
